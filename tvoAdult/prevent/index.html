                        others. Kids need to know ways to safely stand up to

                            and advice, even if they can’t solve the problem directly. Encourage
                            the child to report bullying if it happens.

                            do if those actions don’t work, like walking away

                    <h2> Keep the Lines of Communication Open </h2>

                    <p>
                        Research tells us that children really do look to parents
                        and caregivers for advice and help on tough decisions.
                        Sometimes spending 15 minutes a day talking can reassure kids
                        that they can talk to their parents if they have a problem.
                        Start conversations about daily life and feelings with questions
                        like these:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> What was one good thing that happened today? Any bad things? </li>
                        <li> What is lunch time like at your school? Who do you sit with? What do you talk about? </li>
                        <li> What is it like to ride the school bus? </li>
                        <li> What are you good at? What would do you like best about yourself?</li>
                    </ul>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2> Encourage Kids to Do What They Love </h2>

                    <p>
                        Help kids take part in activities, interests,
                        and hobbies they like. Kids can volunteer, play
                        sports, sing in a chorus, or join a youth group or
                        school club. These activities give kids a chance
                        to have fun and meet others with the same interests.
                        They can build confidence and friendships that help
                        protect kids from bullying.
